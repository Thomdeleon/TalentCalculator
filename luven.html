	<li><span class="bold-orange">Bear Spirit:</span> The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 25 + <span class="tpScaling" tpScaling-base="1">0</span>. In addition, you and your allies gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws while in the aura.</li>
	<li><span class="bold-orange">Hawk Spirit:</span> The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit's aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.</li>
	<li><span class="bold-orange">Unicorn Spirit:</span> The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit's aura. In addition, if you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to any creature inside or outside the aura, each creature of your choice in the aura also regains hit points equal to your druid level.</li>

				<div class="description"><h2>Solid Fog (5th Level Conjuration)</h2><span>5th Level Conjuration spell. Requires concentration. This spell functions like Fog Cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and makes all melee attack rolls with disadvantage. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can’t take a 5-foot step while in solid fog. However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round. </span></div>

Grounding totem always succeeds and cannot be counterspelled or dispelled. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

	<li>If the creature fails its save and it is large or smaller, it is caught in the cyclone, being restrained and caught by it until the spell ends or until it somehow manages to teleport/anchor itself out of its effect. While restrained in this manner, a creature is carried in the cyclone, moving along with it as it crosses the battlefield. Teleporting out of a cyclone requires a spell check against your spell save DC.</li>
	<li>For huge and gargantuan creatures, they must make a strength save against your spell DC or else they are restrained by this cyclone while it is on top of them. If they succeed, the cyclone is treated as difficult terrain.</li>
	<li>A creature is also stunned the first time it is restrained by the cyclone and must roll a constitution saving throw at the end of every turn to stop being stunned. </li>
