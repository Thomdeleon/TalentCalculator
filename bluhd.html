Like all archdemons, Mammon can stay on the field for up to 10 minutes and cannot be summoned alongside another archdemon. Unlike most archdemons, Mammon cannot be attacked nor can Mammon attack things directly. While Mammon is active, you may choose to use any one of the following abilities as an action (unless otherwise specified). Each ability requires gold, which disappears from your inventory upon use.

This damage cannot be avoided, but a successful wisdom save can halve the damage. Like scrying, the success of this ability depends on your familiarity to the target. Use the scrying table to determine the DC adjustment to resist this attack. When attacking with Blood Diamond, if the target resists your attack, your face will be revealed to them. </li>
					<li><span class="bold-indigo">Crown Jewel:</span> Costs 1,000 gold. Like Geas but stronger. The designated target within 60 ft must pass a Wisdom saving throw against your spell DC or suffer the effects of Crown Jewel.

If successful, the spell gets absorbed by your runes and can be later cast as if it were a known spell. You can only carry one absorbed spell at a time. This absorbed spell dissipates upon use or long rest.</span></div>

					<li>A flying speed of 60 feet</li> 
					<li>+2 to attack and spell DC </li>
					<li>Resistance to all damage </li> 
					<li>A healing factor of 1d8 hp per round. </li>
					<li>When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the spell’s level.</li>
