This damage cannot be avoided, but a successful wisdom save can halve the damage. Like scrying, the success of this ability depends on your familiarity to the target. Use the scrying table to determine the DC adjustment to resist this attack. When attacking with Blood Diamond, if the target resists your attack, your face and name will be revealed to them. </li>
					<li><span class="bold-indigo">Crown Jewel:</span> Costs 1,000 gold. Like Geas but stronger.

				<div class="description"><h2>Exsanguinate</h2><span>(9th Level Enchantment spell. Single target. 60 foot range.) If the target creature has blood coursing through its body and has less than 125 hp, you exsanguinate it, killing it instantly with necrotic damage and gaining hp equal to half the amount of health it had remaining. If the target has more than 125 hp, the target takes 10d10 necrotic damage instead and you gain half the amount in health. If exsanguinate kills the target, you regain the spell slot used to cast it.</span></div>

				<div class="description"><h2>Hot Blooded</h2><span>Costs 1/4 of total HP. On your turn, you can expend health equal to 1/4 of your total health in order to gain an extra action. You may cast multiple spells per turn with this ability. You may only do this once per turn. You cannot use this ability if you are below 25% total health.</span></div>

				<div class="description"><h2>Blood Pool</h2><span>Costs 1/5th of total HP. As a reaction, you can change into a pool of blood, rendering you immune to the damage and effects of the next incoming attack or ability, unless it is a mind-affecting ability. If the incoming attack is a mind-affecting ability (ie intelligence, wisdom, or charisma saving throw), you must still roll against the spell save to resist it, although you will not take damage from its effects. You cannot use this ability if you are below 20% total health. </span></div>
